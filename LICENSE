This is just a placeholder.  I haven't decided on what the final license
will be.  But it most likely (note the "likely" - I'm not promising
anything until I've made a real decision) will have the following
properties:

 - it will _require_ source code for the library itself (ie GPL-like in
   that respect). Much like the LGPL.

 - but it will expressly allow linking with arbitrary back-ends, and
   require that too in perpetuam (ie anti-GPL in that respects, and this
   means that it's almost certainly not going to be LGPL)

and, if possible:

 - it will be "open source(tm)" compatible as far as I can tell,
   although if the anti-GPL part ends up being a problem, I may not care
   enough to conform fully to OSI guidelines.  Will need to check with
   the OSI guys. 

In the meantime, if you agree with the above, and expect to agree with
whatever license I will choose with the above in mind, you can play with
this freely, and make changes and send patches if you explicitly mark
those patches as being compatible with whatever I do (yeah yeah, you'll
just need to trust me).

Oh, and keep in mind that I'm famous for changing my mind.  Maybe I'll
call the license the "sucker" license, and sell whatever you send me for
billions and billions of dollars without crediting you in the
slightest..  Sucka!
