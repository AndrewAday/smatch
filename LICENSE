Smatch is released under the GPLv2+ license however Smatch includes the Sparse
source as well which is licensed under the MIT license and cwchash which is
licensed under the three clause BSD license and avl.[ch] which are MIT licensed.

The line between which files are a part of Sparse and which are a part of Smatch
is normally pretty clear.  The one thing I will clarify is that there are some
modifications to Sparse files in the Smatch repository which have not been
pushed to the Sparse repository.  These are released under the MIT license.  The
token_store.c file is a Sparse feature and thus released under the MIT license
despite that it has not been pushed to the Sparse repository.

I will not accept additional Sparse features except under the MIT license.
